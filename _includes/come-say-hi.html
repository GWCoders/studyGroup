                    <span style="color:white; font-size:1.5em">GW Coders is excited to announce a scholarship opportunity for students from traditionally underrepresented groups in coding, who are interested in public interest research or career paths.  
<br><br>
                            <b>Scholarships:</b>  Three (3) credit hours of tuition for a coding course offered at GW in Fall 2021. Courses can be in Python, R, Java, or another coding language.  
<br><br>
        <b>Who is eligible:</b> Current GW studentsâ€¦<br>
(i) who have not taken prior coding courses, <br>
(ii) who are passionate about public interest research or career, <br>
